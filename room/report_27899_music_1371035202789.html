    	 		<p><p>A. Find a good teacher.He will give you targets to aim for, on a short term and long term basis.</p>

<p>B.Assuming you know a good few basic chords, put the radio/CD player etc. on and just jam along to whatever is playing- find the key, play chords,make up lead breaks.You've played for a couple of years, so this will not be impossible.Don't keep going over the same song, unless you've a burning desire to learn that one in particular.</p>

<p>C. Find someone (or two) to play with.Share songs, even if you don't like them much (the songs !) Jam over some 12 bars in different keys, maybe even work out a couple of numbers -you can sing- and do an open mic. session.</p>

<p>D. By all means have a dabble on another instrument - keys are good - because you'll be making probably the same music but through a different medium.One will complement the other.</p>

<p>E.Good luck !</p>

    	 		<p><p>You seem to have a couple of separate questions here. If you want to play that intro, practice should give you that relatively quickly. But from what you are saying I would guess you don't want to practice, as that is the bit you don't enjoy any more, so I would suggest avoiding that piece for now.</p>

<p>Instead, find some music you enjoy listening to and just play along - jamming with it at first, not worrying about exact notes. If you enjoy this, keep going - you need to rediscover your enthusiasm for playing music. Play some classics. Record some backing tracks and get into the enjoyment of playing. Then when you reach the limit of your ability you should hopefully be inspired to push a bit further.</p>

    	 		<p><p>I play piano, not guitar.  Take my advice with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>For me, I keep going to learn new songs.  Not just a quick run through of the chords, but to play the songs the way they're supposed to be played - all of the detail and all of the feel plus my feel on top.</p>

<p>Keep a minimum of 4 songs in your brain, and practice them, say, once a week so you don't forget.  If there are too many songs to fit in your brain, record them and be done with them and keep the top ones in there.</p>

<p>Play those songs for other people.  Keep learning new stuff.  Sounds like you just haven't found a teacher that clicks with you.  Keep looking.</p>

    	 		<p><p>I think the first question you need to answer is what made you inspired to play when you started, and what kept you inspired for those first 2 years when it was fun?  If the reason that it's not fun anymore is because you're not learning anything new, then you need to learn something new.  If there's nothing new in the books you have or any online resources, you can go to another teacher or just pick something yourself and do it.  I prefer the second option because you will be in control of what you are learning.  </p>

<p>Take the intro to the song in your question and figure it out.  It may take an hour or two, or it may take a week or two, but do it.  If you're tired of playing the same old noodley stuff, don't let yourself play it.  Force yourself to try something you don't know how to do.  That's the critical part and also the hardest part when you are self-learning.  Without someone to tell you what to practice, you have to give yourself those things.  </p>

<p>It's also possible that you just have completely lost the drive to play guitar.  There's no shame in that.  But you need to figure out if what made it fun early on can be recaptured.  </p>

    	 		<p><p><a href="http://www.wikitabs.org/wiki/Wikitabs" rel="nofollow">WikiTabs</a> has thousands of song tabs in Wiki form.</p>

<p>There is also <a href="http://my.vexflow.com/" rel="nofollow">MyVexFlow</a>.
